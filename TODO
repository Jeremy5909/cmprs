TODO:
	1. Everything
	2. Is ts memory safe
	3. Test of msker
	4. Figure out LZMA implementation
		- XZ, bzip, gzip etc?
		- Write own?
		- Use code from one of above project in our own way
	4. More testing
	5. Make it compress and uncompress
	6. shafile implementation
	7. Make user friendly
		- automatically stops when it is small enough
		- target sizes
		- multithread???
		- Tie shafile to the end of the .cmprs file so u dont need 2 files
			- Make this optional so it could be "password protected"
		- ETAs
	8. TESTING AGAIN

Questions:
	Should the final shasum be the shasum for the target file/tar?
	How do we make this efficient?
	SHould we try my compression idea later? - andrew
